# Spring Boot with ORM, JPA, Hibernate, MySQL.

This project is part of the Udemy course: Spring Framework for Beginners (lesson 36+). Note that this is my own interpretation using Spring Boot instead of manual configuration.

To sum it up:

* Spring Boot project with ORM, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL.
* Has a default Spring Boot .gitignore file.
